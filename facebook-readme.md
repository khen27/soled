# Facebook Details for SoleD Development

## Set Up

To enable SoleD to have access to Facebook login functionalities, we had to set up a SoleD email address and facebook developer account. Below is the information needed to log-in to these accounts:

- SoleD email:
    - Address: **soledappdev@gmail.com**
    - Password: **developingSoled**
- Facebook account:
    - Username: **soledappdev@gmail.com**
    - Password: **developingSoled**
    - Associated Phone Number [This needs to be changed at some point]: **(248) 497 - 7785** 

From here, we needed to set up a Facebook developer account to register the SoleD application itself with Facebook's services. Log-in to https://developers.facebook.com/ with the 'Facebook account' credentials above to access the app's Facebook settings.
